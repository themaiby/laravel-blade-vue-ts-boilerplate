# Laravel + Vue + Typescript boilerplate

Completely ready to work boilerplate.

### Features includes:
* Vue.js
* Typescript
* ESLint + Airbnb config
* Enabled hot-reloading mode with `yarn server`
* On `yarn build` webpack replace default laravel view (*index.blade.php*) by injected and configured HTML with js bundle

### What configurable

All what you want :)
For example: for configuration default view layout (e.g. set initial state) you can modify *vue/public/index.html* file.

### ToDo:
* Docker HTTPS support
